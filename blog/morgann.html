            <p><b>
                Have you every felt like being a pain to your friends is just too much effort? Like there was a way to... automate insults? <br>
                A common issue, I know. With the world in lockdown and nothing better to do, my friends and I took to insulting one particular friend at every chance we got, which naturally led to the need for an automated system to handle it when we couldn't.
            </b></p>
        </header>

        <!-- CONTENT -->
        <main class="main responsive">
            <p>
                I set it up so whenever he would post a message to our group server on Discord (basically a voice and text-messaging service, for those who don't know), Morgann would automatically reply with a random insult from the list I gave him. <br>
                Already, this was a brilliant addition to our server, but I wanted to take this a step further. So, naturally, I added a bunch of features.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Adding insults:</b> I was sick of having to manually add insults to a save file myself, so I gave everyone the power to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adding quotes:</b> Late-night gaming sessions lead to some cracking quotes being said, and naturally we needed a system to store and show them on demand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Targeting someone else:</b> Throwing insults at one friend is fun enough, but eventually we had the need to insult other people, so I let Morgann target other people, too.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                This all went well, however I had a couple of serious problems beginning to arise. <br>
                First of all, I was running the entirety of Morgann off of my computer, which meant that once I went to bed other people couldn't add insults or target people. And because nobody except me has a normal sleeping pattern, this became a problem. <br>
                Secondly, everything was stored inside a couple of .txt files on my hard drive, which meant it was very easy to corrupt data if something went wrong. <br>
                And lastly, I thought other people would want to have Morgann on their servers, and because all the save data was global, I had a serious privacy issue. <br> <br>

                It was fairly obvious to me that Morgann was in dire need of a rework, and so I set about doing this. There was a couple of things I wanted to change the second time around, though:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Planning:</b> The original Morgann was built around me learning Python, which meant it was messy and janky like nothing else, so I wanted to fix that with the rework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Saving:</b> My biggest concern with storing everything in .txt files is that they cannot handle asynchronous saving requests. Because Discord handles messages asynchronously, though, this could cause a serious problem if two people were to add an insult at the same time because corruption and stuff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Moderator tools:</b> It had become clear to me by this point that Morgann could get fairly intrusive, so I wanted to allow moderators to dial back his annoyance if need be.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To fix the biggest of these issues, saving, I decided to use a fully-fledged database to store everything, and eventually settled on an SQL database hosted through Heroku. Heroku is super neat because it hosts Morgann and the database, and I can access the database from on my computer, which meant I didn't have to guess how Morgann would function before uploading it. Also, it's free. <br> <br>

                So with that sorted, I got to work on the new update, and less than a month later I had, for the most part completed, Morgann, with the following features added:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Removing insults & quotes:</b> Everyone knows that one guy who always comes up with the worst stuff to add to the insult list (at least, I do), so I had to add the ability for moderators to remove insults and quotes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Random insults & quotes:</b> I'm not really sure about the logic behind the random insults, but it's basically the target feature but on-demand, I guess?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Insult & quote searching:</b> This one ties fairly closely into removing, because when you have 80 insults and quotes, things can get a bit hectic when randomly finding insults.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Other mod tools:</b> The people needed them, so I gave the ability to limit Morgann to a specific channel and add other roles to utilise mod tools (normally only server owners can use them).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="sep horizontal"></div>

            <p>
                In the end, I learned quite a large amount from this project, actually. <br>
                Firstly, I pretty much learned Python over the course of about a month and a half to code Morgann, so that was nice. Additionally, I realised that quick project turnaround was a huge plus, and it allowed me to move onto other projects and experiment with different things. <br> <br>

                So that's all there is to know about Morgann, really. He was never really intended to be much in the way of usefulness, but through him I learned a bunch and made my friends laugh, so I see that as a win-win.
